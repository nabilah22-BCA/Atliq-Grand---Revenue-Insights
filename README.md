# Atliq-Grand---Revenue-Insights
AtliQ Grands - Revenue Management Insights Dashboard
Project Overview
AtliQ Grands, a leading luxury hotel chain in India, is seeking to regain its market share and increase revenue through data-driven decision-making. Due to competition and previous management challenges, they are experiencing a decline in revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. This project involves creating metrics, developing a dashboard, and providing strategic insights using their historical data.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide AtliQ Grands with key revenue management insights to help them make informed business decisions and regain their competitive edge. This is done by creating a dashboard based on a mock-up provided by the stakeholders, developing necessary metrics, and offering additional insights beyond the original requirements.

Project Components
1. Metrics Creation
Based on the requirements, the following key performance metrics were developed:

Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR): A measure of a hotelâ€™s ability to fill available rooms at an average rate.
Average Daily Rate (ADR): The average revenue earned per occupied room.
Occupancy Rate: The percentage of rooms that are occupied during a given time period.
Market Share: The percentage of total revenue captured by AtliQ Grands compared to its competitors.
Cost of Acquisition (CoA): The expense involved in acquiring a new customer.
Revenue Growth Rate: Tracks the revenue increase over time.
2. Dashboard Development
A visual and interactive dashboard was created using the mock-up provided by the stakeholders. Key features include:

Revenue trends over time (monthly, quarterly, annually).
Comparison with competitors' market share.
Room occupancy and ADR analysis.
Booking sources and performance.
Customer segmentation insights (corporate vs leisure).
3. Insights and Analysis
In addition to the metrics and dashboard, several data-driven insights were extracted:

Seasonal trends: Identified high and low seasons, impacting occupancy and pricing strategies.
Customer segmentation: Provided insights into corporate vs. leisure travelers, enabling targeted marketing strategies.
Booking channel performance: Highlighted the most and least effective booking channels, enabling better allocation of marketing budgets.
Tools Used
Microsoft Excel/Power BI: For data cleaning, metrics calculation, and dashboard creation.
